# Context Loader

Used for loading unit tests in a given file context.

This allows running tests with globals without having to put tests at the bottom of the file.

But globals are bad. Why make this? I need this functionality for [a project](https://github.com/ShMcK/tut-viewer).

Currently supports compilation for:
  * Typescript
